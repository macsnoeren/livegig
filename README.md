This live gig html5 javascript application is written for the drummer of the band. A cheap and easy tool to get the right tempo for each song. It also stops after ten seconds when it has been started. So the drummer does not require three hands to also turn off the click track during the song. The drummer is able to fully focus on the song and get the tempo right in the beginning.
